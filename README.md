This project uses a Naive Bayes classifier (MultinomialNB) to detect whether an email or SMS message is spam or ham (not spam). It includes data preprocessing steps such as loading the dataset, selecting relevant columns, renaming headers, and mapping text labels to numerical values. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate performance, with accuracy and a detailed classification report displayed. The program allows users input their own messages to classify messages as spam or ham in real-time, continuing until they choose to exit.
